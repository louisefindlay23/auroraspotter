# Prototype: Front-End

This is the first version of the Aurora website which is a static site (all content is hard-coded) with no back-end code. Many of the features of the final website have been already implemented such as the login system which is stored in the browserâ€™s LocalStorage.

## Languages Used

HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript

## Libraries Used

jQuery, Leaflet Maps, Mapbox, CryptoJS & Font Awesome

The prototype website can be deployed by cloning this repo. It is recommended to view the [final app](https://auroraspotter.space) instead.
